# DocPay
Broadly, the term "financial technology" can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution and the mobile internet/smartphone revolution, however, financial technology has grown explosively, and fintech, which originally referred to computer technology applied to the back office of banks or trading firms, now describes a broad variety of technological interventions into personal and commercial finance. Looking in-depth as the name suggests DocPay idea is to focus more on the payment mechanism followed by Doctors and Healthcare service providers as we have seen there is a recent increase in online medical services which leads to this problem. The relationship between a healthcare consumer and their healthcare financing should not—and does not—have to be so fraught. As health services becoming increasingly digital, more opportunities open up for companies to stage data-driven interventions that can modernize and hopefully revitalize, our fragmented healthcare networks.
